_let's try something new!_

Call to Action Clarity: The primary call to action should clearly prompt users to "Become a Consultant" and "Book a Consultation". Ensuring clarity here will enhance user engagement.

Color Combination Compliance: While we appreciate the color combination, it's crucial to ensure compliance with WCAG rules. Our recent check with the color contrast checker flagged some issues, so we need adjustments to meet accessibility standards.
Full Width Backgrounds: Each section's background should extend to the full width of the screen for a more cohesive and visually appealing layout.

Certainly! Here's a refined `version` with code examples for each attribute:

- ONe
- Two
- Three
